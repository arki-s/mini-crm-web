# Mini CRM (Frontend)

A small CRM frontend built with Next.js for learning and practice.

## Purpose

This project is a small CRM frontend built to practice a real-world tech stack
(Next.js, TypeScript, TanStack Query) used in my current work.

The goal is not feature completeness, but understanding structure,
data flow, and integration with a REST API.

## Planned Features (MVP)

- Login (JWT-based authentication)
- Deal list with filters (status, keyword, date)
- Deal detail view
- Activity timeline per deal
- Create and update deals and activities

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- TanStack Query
- Zustand (UI state only)
- Tailwind CSS

## Status

🚧 Work in Progress

- Project structure initialized
- Routing skeleton created
- Backend integration coming next
